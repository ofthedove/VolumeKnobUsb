# Volume Knob USB
A knob to control the volume on my computer over USB.

Uses an Arduino Micro with an encoder connected on pins 2, 3, and 7.

Enclosure is 3d printed with the help of some pennies to give it heft. I should do some post-processing to clean up the little divot in the knob but, that's effort. There's barely space inside for both and the jumper wires almost stick out the back a little. I wrapped both the encoder and micro in electrical tape to prevent shorts. It's tight.
